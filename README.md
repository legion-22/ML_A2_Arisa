# Car Price Prediction

This assignment is a machine learning application designed to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as kilometers driven, owner type, mileage, engine capacity, and max power. The model was trained using a dataset of used cars, and predictions are made using two models:

1. **Old Model** - Random Forest (`random_forest_model.pkl`)
2. **New Model** - Improved model with optimized parameters (`A2_car.pkl`)

## Features

- Kilometers Driven (km)
- Owner Type (First, Second, Third, Fourth & Above)
- Mileage (kmpl)
- Engine Capacity (CC)
- Max Power (bhp)

## How to Use

1. Visit the web application.
2. Select the model (Old or New) from the navigation menu.
3. Fill in the car details, such as mileage, engine size, and owner type.
4. Click on "Predict" to get the estimated price of the car.
5. The prediction will be displayed on the screen.
